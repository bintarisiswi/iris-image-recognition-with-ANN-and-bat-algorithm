# iris-image-recognition-with-ANN-backpropagation-and-bat-algorithm
This program is created for iris image recognition using a hybrid backpropagation neural network and bat algorithm. 
There are 60 images used for the training process, and 30 images for the testing process.

The main purpose of making this program is to find out whether the program is able to recognize the iris image that has been inputted. 
So that the final result is either true or false.

Backpropagation neural network architecture, as follows:
- input layer as much as 1 layer, while the number of units is as much as 60;
- hidden layer as much as 1 layer, while the number of units is as much as 60;
- the output layer is 1 layer, while the number of units is 6;

PARAMETER USED:
- number of individuals: 10, 30, 50 individuals;
- loudness: 0.9;
- pulse rate: 0.2, 0.9;
- minimum frequency and maximum frequency: 0 and 100;
- leaning rate: 0.1, 0.5, 0.9;
- maximum iteration: 50000;
- error limit: 0.01.


**The program is created using the Java programming language
